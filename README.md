## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

**CorStream** is a Python library that lets you build elegant, composable pipelines using asynchronous iterables and coroutine-based operators. Think of it like a blend of `asyncio`, `RxPy`, and Unix pipes ‚Äî but designed for readability, type safety, and modern Python development.

With CorStream, you can easily:
- Transform and filter async data flows
- Batch, throttle, or log stream data
- Apply async functions with concurrency control
- Collect or reduce outputs with simple syntax

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You‚Äôll need Python 3.9 or higher and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed:

```
python3 --version
# Should be 3.9+

curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

### Installing

Clone the repo and install dependencies with Poetry:

```
git clone https://github.com/shivkun/corstream.git
cd corstream
poetry install
```

CorStream is also published on PyPI, you can install it directly with:

```
pip install corstream
# or use Poetry
poetry add corstream
```

You can now run tests, examples, or start building pipelines!

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

To run all tests:

```
poetry run pytest
```

### Break down into end-to-end tests

Each operator and sink has its own test file under `tests/`.

Example:

```
tests/test_map.py          # Tests for .map()
tests/test_batch.py        # Tests for .batch()
tests/test_to_list.py      # Tests for .to_list()
```

### And coding style tests

CorStream follows strict linting and formatting with `black`, `mypy`, and `ruff`:

```
poetry run black corstream/
poetry run ruff check corstream/
poetry run mypy corstream/
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Here's a simple pipeline:

```python
from corstream import Stream

async def get_email(user_id: int) -> str:
    return f"user{user_id}@example.com"

async def send_batch(batch: list[str]):
    print("Sending:", batch)

await (
    Stream
    .from_iterable(range(1, 11))
    .filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
    .map_async(get_email, max_concurrency=3)
    .batch(5)
    .log("batch")
    .for_each(send_batch)
)
```
